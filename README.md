**THIS IS VERY EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT FOR TESTNET/PRODUCTION USAGE**

Wings Blockchain Peg Zone implementation based on [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

This is work in progress, yet it supports the following features:

* **Proof Of Authority** (PoA) validators mechanism.
* **N/2+1** confirmations model.
* **Multisignature** based on PoA validators.
* Managing of validators state by PoA consensus.
* Execution of messages (transactions) based on PoA consensus.
* Issuing/destroying new coins based on PoA consensus.
* **86400** blocks interval to confirm call execution under multisig.
* **Support PoS**: staking, delegation, slashing, supply, etc.

Motivation is allowing to moving tokens/currencies between different blockchains and Wings blockchain.

Additional information could be found in other repositories, that presents part of Wings Peg Zones.

# Installation

Before we start you should have a correct 'GOPATH', 'GOROOT' environment variables.

To install fetch this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:WingsDao/blockchain-relay-layer.git

And let's build both daemon and cli:

    GO111MODULE=on go build cmd/wbd/main.go
    GO111MODULE=on go build cmd/wbcli/main.go

Both commands must execute fine, after it you can run both daemon and cli:

    GO111MODULE=on go run cmd/wbd/main.go
    GO111MODULE=on go run cmd/wbcli/main.go

## Install as binary

To install both cli and daemon as binaries you can use Makefile:

    make install

So after this command both `wbd` and `wbcli` will be available from console.

# Usage

First of all we need to create genesis configuration and name of node:

    wbd init <moniker> --chain-id wings-testnet

Where `<moniker>` must be your node name.

Then let's create 4 accounts, one to store coins, the rest for PoA validators:

    wbcli keys add pos
    wbcli keys add bank
    wbcli keys add validator1
    wbcli keys add validator2
    wbcli keys add validator3

Copy addresses and private keys from output, we will need them in the future.

First of all we create `pos` account, this account will be used later as `Proof of Stake` validator.

As you see we create one account calling `bank` where we will be store all generated **WINGS** coins for start,
and then 3 accounts to make them PoA validators, we need at least 3 validators because by default it's a minimum amount of PoA validators to have.

Now let's add genesis account and initiate genesis PoA validators and PoS account:

    wbd add-genesis-account [pos-address]  5000000000000wings
    wbd add-genesis-account [bank-address] 90000000000000000000000000wings
    wbd add-genesis-account [validator-1-address]  5000000000000wings
    wbd add-genesis-account [validator-2-address]  5000000000000wings
    wbd add-genesis-account [validator-3-address]  5000000000000wings

    wbd add-genesis-poa-validator [validator-1-address] [validator-1-eth-address]
    wbd add-genesis-poa-validator [validator-2-address] [validator-2-eth-address]
    wbd add-genesis-poa-validator [validator-3-address] [validator-3-eth-address]

Replace expressions in brackets with correct addresses, include Ethereum addresses, configure chain by Cosmos SDK documentation:

    wbcli config chain-id wings-testnet
    wbcli config output json
    wbcli config indent true
    wbcli config trust-node true

Time to change denom in PoS configuration.
So open `~/.wbd/config/genesis.json` and find this stake settings:

```json
"staking": {
  "params": {
    "unbonding_time": "1814400000000000",
    "max_validators": 100,
    "max_entries": 7,
    "bond_denom": "stake"
  },
  "last_total_power": "0",
  "last_validator_powers": null,
  "validators": null,
  "delegations": null,
  "unbonding_delegations": null,
  "redelegations": null,
  "exported": false
}
```

Change line:

    "bond_denom": "stake"
To:

    "bond_denom": "wings"

By changing this we determine "wings" as staking currency.

Time to prepare `pos` account:

    wbd gentx --name pos --amount 5000000000000wings

After run this command you will see output like:

    Genesis transaction written to "~/.wbd/config/gentx/gentx-<hash>.json"

After you have generated a genesis transaction, you will have to input the genTx into the genesis file, so that WB chain is aware of the validators. To do so, run:

    wbd collect-gentxs
   
To make sure that genesis file is correct:

    wbd validate-genesis

Now we are ready to launch testnet:

    wbd start

## Add/remove/replace validator by multisignature

Before we start managing validators by PoA, let's remember that minimum amount of validators is 3, maximum is 11.

To add new validator use next command:

    wbcli tx poa ms-add-validator [validator-address] [eth-address] --validator-1

Where:

* **[validator-address]** - WB bench32 validator address
* **[eth-address]** - validator ethereum address

To remove:

    wbcli tx poa ms-remove-validator [validator-address] --from validator1

To replace:

    wbcli tx poa ms-replace-validator [old-address] [new-address] [eth-address] --from validator-1

To get validators list (include their amount and required confirmations amount to execute call):

    wbcli query poa validators

To get minimum/maximum validators amount:

    wbcli query poa minmax

To get validator:

    wbcli query poa validator [address]

Where `[address]` is Bech32 WB address.

## Confirm multisignature call

To confirm multisignature call you need to extract call id from transaction execution output and confirm this call
by other validators:

    wbcli tx multisig confirm-call [call-id]

Once call submited under multisignature, there is **86400** blocks interval to confirm it by other validators, if call
not confirmed by that time, it will be marked as rejected.

To revoke confirmation from call:

    wbcli tx multisig revoke-confirm [call-id]

Once call reaches **N/2+1** amount of confirmations, message inside call will be executed.

To get call information:

    wbcli query multisig call [call-id]

To get calls amount:

    wbcli query multisig lastId

## Issuing new currency by multisig

To issue new currency:

    wbcli tx currencies ms-issue-currency [currencyId] [symbol] [amount] [decimals] [recipient] [issueID] [uniqueID]  --from validators1

Where:

| parameter | desc                                                                                                                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **currencyId** | Currency ID.                                                                                                                |
| **symbol**     | Currency symbol/denom to issue.                                                                                             |
| **amount**     | Amount to issue.                                                                                                            |
| **decimals**   | Currency decimals, maximum is 8.                                                                                            |
| **recipient**  | WB address of account who's receiving coins.                                                                            |
| **issueID**    | Any issue id, usually transaction id.                                                                                       |
| **uniqueID**   | Call unique id, required to prevent double spend on issuing new currencies, usually it's sha256(chainId + symbol + txHash), serialized to hex. |

To destroy currency from any account call:

    wbcli tx currencies destroy-currency [symbol] [amount] [recipient] --from account

To get issued currencies demons/symbols:

    wbcli query currencies currency [symbol]

To get specific issue info:

    wbcli query currencies issue [issueID]

To get destroys list:

    wbcli query currencies destroys [page] [limit]

Where:

* **[page]** - page number
* **[limit]** - limit of destroys per page

To get destroy by ID:

    wbcli query currencies destroy [destroyID]

Where:

* **[destroyID]** - destroy ID, usually just from 0 to N.
