# Dfinance Blockchain / Relay Part

Dfinance Blockchain (DN) is based on [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

This is work in progress, yet it supports the following features:

* **PegZone** - peg zone with Ethereum blockchain.
* **Oracles** - price feeds.
* **Smart Contracts** - Move VM integration.
* **Staking** - Cosmos SDK based staking.

Motivation is allowing to implement DeFi products without headache.

Current repository contains source code of:

* **dnode** - dfinance block node.
* **dncli** - command-line interface to iterate with **dnode**.
